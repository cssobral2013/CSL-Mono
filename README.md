# CSL Mono
CSL Mono is developed from and inspired by Cascadia Code and Caskaydia Cove. Main changes are:

- Removed all ligatures (so it is now a fixed-spacing monospace font)
- Modified a,r,s,f in italic
- Modified i,l,W,w in both roman and italic
- Modified vertical spacing
- Redistributed weights
- And others
